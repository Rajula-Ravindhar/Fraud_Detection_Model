# Fraud_Detection_Model
A fraud detection model is a Model That predicts fraud in transactions with an accuracy of 99% in a more generalized way. ex : f1_score : 94% <br>
The model I have used is the XGBOOST Algorithm. <br>
Technologies I used: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn <br>
